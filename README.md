Extract text and its region from image using openCv

I dont actively support this code its just a simple implementation of the project.
 
 --Run--
 1. To run the code you need python and opencv installed on ur system.
 2.and then u can run the code simply by typing
      windows,ubuntu -- python filename.py
 3. I have given different image as the test file, to check each image u can change the filename in the source file
 
      image = cv2.imread('test.jpg')
